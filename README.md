# Qt-QML Application Starter Kit with Hexagonal Architecture

## Overview
This project is a Qt-QML starter kit designed to build scalable and maintainable applications using Hexagonal Architecture principles, while being compatible with the MVC design pattern. It provides a modular and extensible structure that supports plugins for both backend and UI components, modern design themes, and a variety of services for seamless communication and data management. The starter kit is ideal for applications requiring advanced features like remote UI, multi-database support, real-time data streaming, and multiprocessing services.

## Advantages of the Design Pattern

1. **Separation of Concerns**: ✂️ The Hexagonal Architecture clearly separates core business logic from external dependencies, making the application easier to maintain and extend.
2. **Modularity**: 🧩 By adhering to a plugin-based structure, components can be added or replaced without impacting the rest of the system.
3. **Testability**: ✅ Decoupled design ensures that core logic can be tested independently of external services or UI.
4. **Scalability**: 📈 The architecture is well-suited for adding features such as multi-database support, streaming data services, or additional plugins.
5. **Flexibility**: 🤹 Enables support for multiple communication protocols (e.g., MQTT, RabbitMQ, Kafka, REST API, Socket.IO) and remote UI capabilities.
6. **Reusability**: 🔄 Custom components and services are reusable across multiple projects or modules.
7. **Future-Proofing**: 🔮 Designed to accommodate new technologies and standards with minimal disruption.
8. **Ease of Maintenance**: 🛠️ Clear structure and separation of responsibilities simplify debugging and updates.
9. **Enhanced User Experience**: 🌟 With a modern design and theme support, applications built on this starter kit offer a polished and professional UI.
